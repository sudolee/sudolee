
== certificate ==
Test certificate may need to be applied to Windows
before installing the USB host driver. A same certificate
will only need to be added once. Follow the steps listed
below to add test certificate to the system under test.

Note: this certificate is only used for test. You should get yours after WHQL test.
	Details: http://www.microsoft.com/china/ctc/whql/whqlpage.mspx

1. Launch Windows Explorer and locate the certificate file qcusbtest.cer

2. Right-click on qcusbtest.cer and choose Install Certificate.

3. Follow instructions and place the certificate in the
   following certificate stores:
      Trusted Publishers
      Trusted Root Certification Authorities
   Step 1 through 3 will need to be repeated to place the certificate
	  in more than one certificate stores.

4. On Windows Vista, open a Command Prompt with "Run as administrator":
	  Right-click on "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" and click "Run as administrator"
   
5. Perform the following command:
      bcdedit -set testsigning on

   For pre-Vista Windows versions, skip this step.

5. Reboot the system.

6. Install the USB host driver.

== adb ==
1, adb driver cannt be installed ?
	- copy "android-drivers/android_usb.inf" to "android-drivers/i386/"
	- copy "android-drivers/{android_usb.inf, androidusba64.cat}" to "android-drivers/and64/"
	- del "android-drivers/{android_usb.inf, androidusba64.cat}"

== MTP ==
1, Driver of MTP is released by Microsoft, windows 7 is built in by default. winXP need to
	install windows media player at least wmp11 or later.

2, Download wmp11 for winxp there:
	http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-media-player

3, Add you vid, pid and MI in "C:\windows\inf\wpdmtp.inf", like this:

	[Generic.NTx86]
	%GenericMTP.DeviceDesc%=MTP, USB\MS_COMP_MTP
	%GenericMTP.DeviceDesc%=MTP, USB\VID_****&PID_****&MI_**

	[Generic.NTamd64]
	%GenericMTP.DeviceDesc%=MTP, USB\MS_COMP_MTP
	%GenericMTP.DeviceDesc%=MTP, USB\VID_****&PID_****&MI_**

4, use MTP in linux
	- install mtpfs libfuse-dev libmad0-dev
	- mkdir /tmp/mtp-local
	- mtpfs /tmp/mtp-local		(mount mtp device as /tmp/mtp-local)
	- umount /tmp/mtp-local
